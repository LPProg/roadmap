About Me
Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Manuel Lopez, a passionate and motivated individual excited to grow as a professional in the tech world. Although I currently lack extensive professional experience, I'm committed to bridging that gap by challenging myself and continuously learning.

Why I'm Here
To gain hands-on experience and enhance my skills, I plan to complete as many challenges and projects as possible from various roadmaps. These roadmaps will guide me through structured learning paths and practical tasks that I'll use to develop and showcase my abilities.

In case you donÂ´t know what I mean by Roadmaps, I leave the link below so if you are interested you can also partake in them.

My Goals
ðŸ›  Build a solid foundation in Fullstack Development.
ðŸš€ Complete projects and challenges that reflect real-world scenarios.
ðŸŒŸ Create a portfolio filled with meaningful and practical examples of my work.
ðŸ“š Continuously learn, grow, and contribute to the community.

Portfolio
As I complete these challenges, I'll be documenting and displaying my progress here. Check out my portfolio to follow my journey and see what I've accomplished!

Here IÂ´ll add my link to threads, which I donÂ´t really use 24hrs, but I post updates or interesting things for me in the techworld.
